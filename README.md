Demo of hippocampal like network for testing OSB.

**Note: this is only a demo for testing the features of neuroConstruct, NeuroML 2 and OSB, and not a biologically realistic hippocampal model!**

### neuroConstruct project

Example of model running in neuroConstruct:

![nC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSourceBrain/Hippocampus3DDemo/master/images/nC.png)

[Install neuroConstruct](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/neuroConstruct/blob/master/INSTALL) and open the [project](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/Hippocampus3DDemo/tree/master/neuroConstruct). More details [here](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/docs#Using_neuroConstruct_Based_Projects). 


### NeuroML version of project

NeuroML 2 files have been generated from the neuroConstruct project and can be found here: https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/Hippocampus3DDemo/tree/master/neuroConstruct/generatedNeuroML2

### 3D view of network on Open Source Brain

The network above can be pulled from GitHub by OSB and can be viewed in your browser:
